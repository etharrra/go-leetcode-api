```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Endpoints

-   `GET /ping`: Health check endpoint.
-   `GET /api/:username`: Fetches the user profile and submission statistics for the specified LeetCode username.

## Example

```
http://localhost:3000/api/etharrra
```

## Logging

Logs are written to log.log. The loggger package handles the logging functionality.
